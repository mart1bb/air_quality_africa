# air_quality_africa

## The project
The goal of this project is to develop a whole flow of data around air quality in Nairobi. We are going to get IOT sensor data through scraping, explore it, clean it and try to train model on it to predict air quality with temperature and humidity

This data contains sample of IOT sensors in the city. We are going to focus on 5 parameters : temperature (C), humidity(%), P0, P1, P2.
P0 P1 and P2 are the concentration of particulate matter in the air, including particles with diameters less than or equal to 1 micrometer (P0), 2.5 micrometers (P2), and particles with diameters less than or equal to 10 micrometers (P1).
